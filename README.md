# TripSit Ergo IRC server configuration

The current official server is not yet running this configuration and software.

This repository is used to make the configuration file for the server public.
This way anyone can contribute ideas on how to manage the server.

To test the configuration you'll need to install `docker`.

After that you should run the `run.sh` file which will create a docker volume
with `Ergo` and put the config file there and run the server.
